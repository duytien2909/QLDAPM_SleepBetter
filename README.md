3. Create new branch and switch to new branch: `git checkout -b <name of branch>`. Eg `git checkout -b Quy/UI2.1`
4. Add and commit your code: `git add .` and `git commit -m "<your message>"`
5. Push your code to remote: `git push origin <name of branch>`. If you push code to that branch for the first time, you should `git push -u origin <name of branch>`
